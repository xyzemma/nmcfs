# nmcfs
## Nova Minecraft Function Script
It is highly unlikely that this project is ever going to be finished. Reason: https://github.com/xyzemma/nmcfs/issues/2
The only thing that could save it would be Mojang fixing their shit
# Update 4. August 2025:
I am considering restarting the project, this time writing it in Rust and trying my best to work around minecraft's limitations
